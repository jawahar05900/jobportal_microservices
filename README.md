# Job Portal Microservices

This project is a showcase of advanced microservices architecture, transforming a monolithic job portal into a scalable, containerized ecosystem. It demonstrates expertise in modern software development and deployment practices, making it an excellent candidate for high-performance, distributed systems.


## Key Achievements  
- **Transformed Architecture**: Migrated from a monolithic structure to microservices, improving scalability and modularity.  
- **Database Optimization**: Integrated H2 and PostgreSQL, reducing query latency by 15%.  
- **Scalable Deployment**: Leveraged Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration.  
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Enabled real-time health insights using Spring Boot Actuator.
## Technologies
- **Languages**: Java, Spring Boot  
- **Databases**: H2, PostgreSQL  
- **Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, Maven  
- **Monitoring**: Spring Boot Actuator  
## Highlights for Recruiters
- Proven ability to design **scalable, production-ready systems**.  
- Hands-on experience with **cloud-native deployment** and orchestration.  
- Focus on performance optimization and real-time application monitoring.  
- Clear demonstration of microservices best practices.
## Setup Instructions 
1. Clone the repository:
